/**
 * This package aims at being the home of a DSL as outline on the <a href="http://concordion.org/Technique.html">Concordion - Technique</a> site.<br/>
 * Currently it's mostly static, but i guess we will need to introduce SPI instead, so that we can e.g. exchange the current simple drivers with swing or web UI drivers.
